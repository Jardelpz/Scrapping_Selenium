This project was designed to automate my monthly routine. Every month I have to generate the download of my college's bank slip. With what has been done, 
it is only necessary to run the project and I will have in my "preferential" email the bank slip as well as the financial history of payments.

## Getting Started

### Running the project 
    * Build a new venv
    * Run  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt  ```


## Built With

* [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) - JavaScript runtime built
* [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) - Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control Chrome

## Next Step

Write some text automatically into a readme.md like an introduction to theme

This project looks great, - it's time to merge! :shipit:
